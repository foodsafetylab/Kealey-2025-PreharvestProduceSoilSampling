# Preface

This workbook describes the analysis of 16S microbiome data from Stasiewicz lab. Code (not shown in the report) is initialized and loaded here. We don't include the code in the report but make this available as needed; please see the [Github repository]({{< var Github_repository >}}) for this project for the final version (requires permissions).

Data from the primary project folder should be downloaded from [here]({{< var Box >}}) (requires permissions). Note the following assumes all data are in the **data/** folder, and all paths in the code will very likely need to be modified to rerun these (this is partly due to how the code and relevant parts of the analysis are sourced).

## Project Structure

This project contains a directory called **{{< var folder >}}**, the qmd files are located directly under the project folder. The following directories are in the main project directory:

-   **src**: contains the *common_code.R* that is loaded for each qmd file

-   **data**: contains the processed data files that will be imported to the qmd to create the phyloseq object, and a *metadata.csv* file that I created based on the sample information provided by the PI

-   **results**: contains the results for each step.

Note that we only send you the report and the code is on Github with directory structure but you would have to clone the Git repository and download the data from Box to be able to run the code.

We provide you a folder called **_book** that contains the index.html file needed to open the book report plus all the images created in the report.
