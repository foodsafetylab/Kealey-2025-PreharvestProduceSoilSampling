## Overview
Bootie and drag swabs may collect more microbiologically representative aggregative soil samples than composite grabs from produce fields. Previous experimental field work has identified some practical wetting agents as potential alternatives to traditionally used skim milk. This study validates the two most promising wetting agents, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and buffered peptone water (BPW), by comparing swabs results from 100 m tracks though a melon farm (262,000m2), a mixed agriculture farm (leafy green, peppers, beets, 4,500m2), and an apple orchard (114,000m2). The mean difference between paired samples collected with BPW or PBS ranged from -0.02±0.09 to 0.26±0.09 Log<sub>10</sub>(CFU/g) for aerobic plate count (APC) and total coliforms (TC). Bootie and drag swabs recovered greater APCs (mean difference 0.63±0.38 to 1.83±0.24 Log<sub>10</sub>(CFU/g)) and TCs (mean difference 1.32±0.96 to 5.32±1.03 Log<sub>10</sub>(CFU/g)), and greater prevalence of _Escherichia coli_ compared to soil grabs (90% versus 44% of samples positive by enrichment, p<0.001). By 16S sequencing, samples collected with PBS had greater within sample (alpha) diversity than BPW (p-values 0.009 to 0.059), but similarly overlapping taxa. Soil samples had higher within sample (alpha) diversity (p<0.05), but lower between (beta) sample diversity compared to booties and drags. Overall, there was no biologically meaningful difference between the performance of the two wetting agents for bootie and drag swabs, and compared to composite soil samples, these two swab methods recovered more indicator organisms from produce field soil representing five different commodities.

## Usage
### Setup
All statistical analyses and graphs were made using JMP Pro 18 or R version 4.3.3.

Microbial community analysis for alpha and beta diversity was performed by the High-Performance Computing in Biology (HPCBio) group at Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center at the University of Illinois. Data was imported and processed in R version 4.4.1, with quality control checks using DADA2.
